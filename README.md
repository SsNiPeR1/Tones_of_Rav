# Tones of Rav
A game where you have to guess how TON price will change in a fixed amount of time.

There are two timers: bet timer and waiting timer. While bet timer is working, you have three buttons with results of the game. You can choose multiple results, for example, you may think that price will either stay as it was in the start of the game, or it will go down. You bet TON, as other players do. When bet timer's exhausted, players have to wait until round ends. All winning players will get their reward from those, who lost.
